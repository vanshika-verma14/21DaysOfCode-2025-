## 1. Find the Unique Element
A problem that requires finding the single element that appears only once while all others appear twice.

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, where every element appears exactly **twice** except for one element that appears only **once**, find and return the element that appears only once.

**Your task:** Find and return the element that appears only once in the array.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [2, 2, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```
**Output:**
```
4
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1]
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

## 2. Find the Missing Number
A problem that introduces mathematical relationships in arrays using expected vs actual sums.

Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is **missing** from the array.

This problem introduces you to **mathematical relationships in arrays** and teaches you about the concept of **expected vs actual sums**. It's a classic example of using mathematical properties to solve array problems efficiently.

**Your task:** Find the missing number from the sequence 0 to n.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [3, 0, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:** The array should contain numbers from 0 to 3, but 2 is missing

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [0, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:** The array should contain numbers from 0 to 2, but 2 is missing

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
8
```
**Explanation:** The array should contain numbers from 0 to 9, but 8 is missing

---

## 3. Check if Array is Palindrome
A problem that introduces palindrome detection algorithms and symmetry checking.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, determine if the array is a **palindrome** (reads the same forwards and backwards). Return `true` if it is, otherwise `false`.

This problem introduces you to **palindrome detection algorithms** and **symmetry checking**, which are important concepts in pattern recognition and string/array analysis.

**Your task:** Determine if the array is a palindrome and return true or false.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
false
```

---

**Input:**
```
nums = [5, 5, 5, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
true
```
